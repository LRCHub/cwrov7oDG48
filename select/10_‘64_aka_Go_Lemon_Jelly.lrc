[00:00.17] Go
[00:25.89] Go
[00:26.89] 
[00:40.84] And so i went, alone
[00:51.90] East, west
[00:54.08] East, west
[00:56.37] East, west
[00:58.48] East, west

[01:07.20] From dawn 'til setting sun
[01:09.23] East, west
[01:11.31] East, west
[01:13.43] East, west
[01:15.74] East, west

[01:47.94] The mountain quest
[01:49.82] I knew someday I'd face the test
[02:05.82] 
[02:25.47] And sure enough

[04:44.29] A moment later
[04:51.29] 
[06:03.16] And so at last
[06:06.08] I understood
[06:18.04] Go
