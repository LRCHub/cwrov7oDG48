You know the band was rockin', goin' round and round
Yeah reelin' and rockin' what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rockin'
Till the band is down

I looked at my watch it was nine twenty one
Well, we clap and havin' nothin' but fun
Oh yeah, yeah reelin' and rockin'
We were reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

I looked at my watch, it was nine thirty-two
There's nothin' I'd rather do than rock 'n' roll with you
Oh yeah-yeah, yeah reelin' and rockin'
We were reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

Yeah, I looked at my watch and to my surprise
I was dancin' with a woman who's twice my size
Oh yeah-yeah, reelin' and rockin'
We were reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

I looked at my watch and it was time to go
The Shads told me "They won't playin' no more"
Come on kid, yeah reelin' and rockin'
We were reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' till the break of dawn

You know they'd never stop rockin', goin' round and round
Oh, reelin' and rockin' what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rockin'
Till the band is down
